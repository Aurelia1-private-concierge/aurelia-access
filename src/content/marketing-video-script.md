# Aurelia Private Concierge — Marketing Video Script
## "Beyond Ordinary" Campaign | Duration: 90 seconds

---

### OPENING (0:00 - 0:12)
**[VISUAL: Sunrise over Monaco harbor, slow aerial reveal of superyachts]**

**VOICEOVER (George - Sophisticated British Male):**
> "There exists a world beyond the ordinary. A realm where time bends to your will, where doors remain open only for those who belong."

---

### ACT I: THE PROBLEM (0:12 - 0:25)
**[VISUAL: Quick cuts — crowded airports, waiting lists, declined reservations, clock ticking]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "You've achieved what others only dream of. Yet you find yourself waiting. Negotiating. Compromising. The irony of success: more resources, less time to enjoy them."

---

### ACT II: THE REVELATION (0:25 - 0:45)
**[VISUAL: Private jet tarmac transfer, Michelin-starred kitchen, art gallery private viewing]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Aurelia was born from a singular conviction: that those who have everything should never have to ask twice."

> "We are not a service. We are your invisible hand — anticipating desires before they form, securing the impossible before you realize you wanted it."

---

### ACT III: THE EXPERIENCE (0:45 - 1:10)
**[VISUAL: Montage — penthouse keys exchanged, vintage Patek Philippe acquisition, Monaco Grand Prix paddock access, Maldives overwater villa at sunset]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "From off-market real estate in Geneva to front-row seats at sold-out performances. From rare vintage timepieces to spontaneous escapes aboard chartered yachts."

> "Our network spans five continents. Our discretion, absolute. Your preferences, remembered. Your privacy, sovereign."

---

### ACT IV: THE INVITATION (1:10 - 1:25)
**[VISUAL: Elegant hands opening a black envelope with gold wax seal, revealing membership card]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Membership is by invitation only. We accept just fifty new members each year — not by limitation, but by commitment to those we serve."

---

### CLOSING (1:25 - 1:30)
**[VISUAL: Aurelia logo materializes in gold against obsidian black, tagline appears]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Aurelia. Beyond service. Beyond expectation."
